		  <h1>Glossary of Mycological Terms</h1>
	  </header>
	  <main>
	    <p><strong>Aphyllophorales</strong> - An old-school category (an obselete order) for homobasidiomycetes (fungi with non-septate basidia) without gills, which included crust fungi, polypores, coral mushrooms, and others, but excluded puffballs, which were given there own order (also obsolete) called Gasteromycetales. See the <a href="phylogeny.html">Phylogeny page</a> for the history of fungal classification.</p>
	    <p><strong>Basidium (pleural: basidia)</strong> - The sexually reproductive cell characteristic of fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota (and therefore, all crust fungi). Basidia vary enormously in their form, but they all have sterigmata (horn-like projections) upon which basidiospores are formed, like a balloon being blown up.</p>
		  <p><strong>Basidiospores</strong> - Haploid propagative cells (spores) formed via meiosis (sexual reproduction) on the sterigmata of basidia. Basidiospores contrast with chlamydospores, which are asexual spores formed via mitosis (no genetic recombination) produced by some basidiomycetes. Most basidiospores are ballistospores, referring to their method of ection achieved through a <a href="https://pringlelab.botany.wisc.edu/documents/Ballistospore.pdf" target="_blank">very neat feat of biophysics</a> in which the surface tension of a tiny drop of liquid breaks causing the spore to launch off into space.</p>
		  <p><strong>Basidioma (pleural: basidiomata)</strong> - The "fruiting body", or more accurately, sporocarp, of a basidiomycete fungus; in other words, the sexually reproductive component of a basidiomycete. This contrasts with the "vegetative body" of the fungus, the mycelium, a collection of hyphae that "eat" by digesting organic matter in the surroundings and absorbing the yummy breakdowns. Note that since fungi were originally thought of as plants and not their own kingdom (evolutionarily speaking, they are more similar to animals, sharing a more recent common ancestor with humans than they do with squash), much of the colloquial terminology is adapted from plant-speak. When reviewing the terminology below, recognize that multiple terms can apply to a basidioma. For example, a basidioma could be orbicular and resupinate (round and fully attached to the substrate), but some terms are mutually exclusive, like effused and orbicular, as they refer to opposite growth patterns</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>Cupulate</b> - basidioma growing as a cup-like structure</li> 
			  <li><b>Decorticant</b> - basidioma developing under bark, with the bark pulling away exposing the basidioma when mature</li>
			  <li><b>Effused</b> - in normal speak, effuse is a verb that means "to exude, to flow out, to pour forth", capturing well the structure of many basidiomata; effused fruiting bodies are spread out over the substrate without a regular form or a pileus, which contrasts with orbicular (circular) basidiomata, for example</li>
			  <li><b>Effused-reflexed</b> - basidioma spreading over the substrate (effused) and then turning back (reflexed) at the margin forming a pileus (cap)</li>
			  <li><b>Orbicular</b> - basidioma circular in shape</li>
			  <li><b>Resupinate</b> - basidioma fully attached to the substrate, not forming a shelf-like cap </li>
			  <li><b>Stipitate</b> - pileate basidioma with a stipe (a sporocarp with a stem and cap)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Corticioid fungi</strong> - Also called crust fungi, corticioid fungi are "basidiomycetes with effused basidiomata, a smooth, meruloid, or hydnoid hymenophore, and holobasidia" (Larsson 2007). Let's break that down. Crusts are fungi that produce simple sporocarps (in other words, fruiting bodies or mushrooms) that lay flat against the substrate, usually on the bottom of a piece of wood; have a fertile surface that is either smooth, wrinkled, or with teeth-like projections (or of intermediate form); and produce spores on special reproductive cells called basidia that are not divided by septa. Note that corticioid fungi are a form group, meaning crusts are not necessarily closely related to one other. Many fungi have converged upon a crust-like growth form to spread their spores. What one calls a crust or not a crust can sometimes be arbitrary; the definition above is not absolute. For example, some poroid resupinate fungi are generally considered to be crusts, as well as non-resupinate fungi with a smooth hymenium.</p>
		  <p><strong>Corticiology</strong> - The scientific study of corticioid fungi.</p>
		  <p><strong>Cystidium (pleural: cystidia)</strong> - A sterile cell (one that does not produce spores) embedded within or projecting out of the hymenium, sometimes covered with crystals of calcium oxalate. There is an enormous diversity of cystidia and they are often very important microscopic features for identification of crust fungi. There is different terminology referring to the location, origin, and type of the cystidium.</p>
		  <h4><strong><em>Location</em></strong></h4>
		  	<ul>
				<li><b>Chelocystidia</b> - cystidia on the edge of a gill</li>
				<li><b>Pleurocystidia</b> - cystidia on the face of a gill</li>
		  	</ul>
		  <h4><em><strong>Origin</strong></em></h4>
		  	<ul>
				<li><b>Hymenial cystidia</b> - cystidia arising in the hymenium or subhymenium</li>
				<li><b>Pseudocystidia </b> - cystidia arising from the trama or subiculum</li>
		  	</ul>
		  <h4><em><strong>Types</strong></em></h4>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>Astrocystidia (also called asterocystidia)</b> - </li>
			  <li><b>Gloeocystidia</b> -</li>
			  <li><b>Halocystidia</b> -</li>
			  <li><b>Lagenocystidia</b> - </li>
			  <li><b>Lamprocystidia (also called metuloids)</b> -</li>
			  <li><b>Leptocystidia</b> -</li>
			  <li><b>Lyocystidia</b> - </li>
			  <li><b>Septocystidia</b> - multicellular cystidia with septa (barriers between cells)</li>
			  <li><b>Subulate cystidia</b> - cystidia that taper to a point, when encircled by rectangular crystals characteristic of the genus <em>Subulicystidium</em></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Homobasidiomycetes</strong> - An old-school term that is synonymous with Agaricomycetes, the class that contains corticioid fungi, in the subphylum Agaricomyctina and the phlyum Basidiomycota, originally referring to basidiomycetes whose basidia are not septate. This contrasts with the rusts, smusts, and jelly fungi, which were called heterobasidiomycetes.</p>
		  <p><strong>Mushroom odors</strong> - Mushrooms can delight or sour the nostrils with their strange odors.</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>Odor</b> - </li>
			  <li><b>Odor</b> -</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Pileipellis (plural: pileipelles)</strong> - The uppermost layer of hyphae in the pileus (cap) of a fungal sporocarp; in other words, the outermost "skin" of hyphae covering the trama (flesh) of the cap. The terms <em>cuticle</em> and <em>pileipellis</em> are essentially synonymous, however the first is used in reference to the layer as a macroscopic object ("can I peel the cuticle off this mushroom?") and the latter as a microscopic object ("how are the hyphae arranged in the pileipellis of this mushroom?"). Note that most crusts don't have caps and therefore don't have a pileipellis. Even if the pileipellis isn't the most important feature for identification of crusts (unlike boletes where it can be crucial), the following terminology referring to different types of pileipelles is sometimes important to know.</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>Cutis</b> - hyphae are arranged parallel to the cap's surface; when the hyphae are gelatinized, a cutis pileipellis is referred to as an <em>ixocutis</em></li>
			  <li><b>Epithelium</b> - hyphae arise perpendicular to the cap surface and are swollen and frequently septate, also described <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JYObgVVjb9EC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=palisadoderm+vs+hymeniderm&source=bl&ots=jJKlWAgZoW&sig=tbYL-I3Iqn2HL96vRHbKNlUpbmg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6xraXj6XcAhVDWK0KHST0BoMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=palisadoderm%20vs%20hymeniderm&f=false">"as erect chains of globose elements"</a></li>
			  <li><b>Hymeniderm (or hymeniform)</b> - hyphae arise perpendicular to the cap surface and are club shaped and inflated resembling immature basidia</li>
			  <li><b>Palisadoderm</b> - like a hymeniderm, except the hyphae are arranged in a looser pattern  and are not so even in height, according to this <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JYObgVVjb9EC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=palisadoderm+vs+hymeniderm&source=bl&ots=jJKlWAgZoW&sig=tbYL-I3Iqn2HL96vRHbKNlUpbmg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6xraXj6XcAhVDWK0KHST0BoMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=palisadoderm%20vs%20hymeniderm&f=false">source</a></li>
			  <li><b>Trichoderm</b> - hyphae arise perpendicular to the cap surface; when the hyphae are gelatinized, a trichoderm pileipellis is referred to as an <em>ixotrichoderm</em></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Septum (pleural: septa)</strong> - A wall that separates one cell from another in a mycelium and basidioma, sometimes bridged by a clamp connection formed during the mitotic reproduction of nuclei and their allocation between two cells; fungi without septa are called <em>aseptate</em> or <em>coenocytic</em>.</p>
