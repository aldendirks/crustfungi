				<p>Besides the old rice burnt onto the bottom of your pot, crusts are fungi of great ecological importance and diversity. You can find them almost anywhere where there is wood, growing on the underside of a stick or log, on the bark of living trees, or even from the ground.</p>
				<p>I'll be the first to admit that these aren't the flashiest of organisms. They are usually small and indiscrete, some nothing more than a sheen or different hue on the bottom of a decaying branch. And no, they are not edible. However, some crusts take on wild textures and colors whose evolutionary purpose defies explanation. If one dares to travel to the microscopic realms, they are greeted by truly bizarre structures like swollen oily cells, crystal-shrouded lances, and spiky clubs. To look into the microscope at a crust is to touch down on an alien planet with fractal geography and ornate constructions.</p>
				<p><strong>Collecting Crusts</strong></p>
				<p>To collect crusts, one must first find them. Unlike the meditative wanderings of mushroom hunters, crusts are most easily discovered by sitting down in a site with lots of fallen branches and looking at the underside of the branches one by one. Log rollin' is another fruitful method. Some distinct crusts (list coming soon) can be identified in the field by their macromorphology alone. Most, however, are impossible to identify to species without microscopic study. Regardless, succesful identification begins with close inspection of the crust and careful notetaking of its features.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Time and Location</b> - Where are you (GPS coordinates are best), what's the date, and how's the weather? Make small talk with the crust.</li>
					<li><b>Substrate</b> - What's the crust growing on? At a minimum, note whether the substrate is hardwood (from a deciduous tree) or softwood (from a conifer). Sometimes the substrate is so far degraded it's impossible to determine its identity, but might be inferred by the woody plants growing around it. Collecting in an arboretum (with permission) or a monoculture of trees is a great way to be sure of the substrate. Also note how degraded the substrate is, whether bark is still present, and the type of rot taking place (soft rot, brown rot, or white rot).</li>
					<li><b>Odor</b> - Bring the crust close and take a sniff. While rarely reported, some crusts have distinct odors that should be noted.</li>
					<li><b>Morphology</b> - With patient observation, there is so much to appreciate about even the seemingly most mundane organisms. What is the shape of the crust? How is it spreading across the substrate? What's the texture (smooth, spiky, bumpy, etc.) and feel of the fungus (waxy, powdery, dry, etc.)? </li>
