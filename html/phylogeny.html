			<p>As a <b>form group</b>, crust fungi are defined not by their evolutionary relatedness but rather their simple mushrooms or fruiting bodies, more accurately called <b>sporocarps</b> (or basidiocarps for basidiomycetes and ascocarps for ascomycetes). In the past, all crust fungi were thought of as closely related species and were placed together in the family <b>Corticiaceae</b>. Nowadays, we can sequence an organism's DNA to more accurately determine its relatedness to other species and this has drastically changed corticioid taxonomy. Crust fungi are actually distributed across most of the orders in the the class Agaricomycetes, which comprises the majority of mushrooms eaten by humans and about 20,000 species &mdash; one-fifth of all described fungi.</p>
			<p>All Agaricomycetes, in fact, may be derived from a crust-like ancestor. Over hundreds of millions of years, fungi have evolved extraordinary shapes, colors, and mechanisms of spore dispersal, but many have retained the crust form, and many others have converged upon this simple morphology. Crusts come and ago again and again over evolutionary time like the kneading of dough. As a result, scientists recognize a very large number of crusts (thousands of species) spread across more than 282 genera and 41 families. Given the fact that we have documented less than 10% of all fungi and that relatively little attention has been devoted to crusts, the number of species of crust fungi is most definitely far greater.</p>
			<p>Here it is necessary to distinguish between phylogeny and taxonomy, although the prior usually informs the latter. Phylogeny refers to the evolutionary relatedness of organisms, or the history of living beings, whereas taxonomy is the art of binning organisms into artificial groups, like kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. A phylogeny is our best hypothesis for how things have evolved and could very well be "true", whereas placing organisms into taxonomic ranks will always be a somewhat arbitrary endeavor.</p>
			<p>Modern taxonomy attempts to place organisms into monophyletic groups (an ancestor and all of its descendants) based on molecular phylogenetics and fossil records, whereas past conceptions placed organisms into groups based on sometimes superficial morphological similarities. One might wonder &mdash; perhaps mycologists who are fed up with trying to keep up with the rapidly changing names &mdash; if binning and grouping is such an artificial process, why bother tieing it to evolutionary history? I believe it is a natural and beautiful thing to reflect the great history of life in organisms' names and that naming organisms according to evolutionary relatedness reveals a whole lot more than it scrambles &mdash; about shared microscopic features, chemistry, ecology, and much more &mdash; while respecting and celebrating the fact that evolution leads to dazzling, and sometimes wholly unexpected, complexity. Below are various classification schemes for crust fungi, moving down from modern to historical conceptions. </p>
			<p><strong>Modern Phylogenetics</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Yeah, Fungi Used To Be Called Plants</strong></p>
			<p>And, to my horror, they still are sometimes. A very beautiful but terribly researched <a href"https://www.amazon.com/Plants-That-Never-Ever-Bloom/dp/0147517494">children's book</a> calls fungi "plants that never ever bloom". Back in the day, long ago, fungi were thought of as plants because they grow from the ground (sometimes). Over time, scientists found that they do not photosynthesize, contain chitin in their cell walls (also found in crustaceans and insects), and have other traits that tell us they are more closely related to animals than they are to plants.</p>
