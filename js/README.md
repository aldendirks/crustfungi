`species_hover-show-image-jquery.js` is the script that adds an image to the screen when the user moves their mouse over the names of species on the `Species` page. This file utilizes jquery. `species_hover-show-image.js` is the old version, preserved for reference, but no longer called in the `species.html` file.
